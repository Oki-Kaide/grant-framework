### Project Details

BlastPad is a project-launching platform created exclusively for the Proton blockchain ecosystem. BlastPad will consist of 4 independent domains coming together on 1 consolidated platform, enabling the individual sites to be used separately or all together. 
The “home page” would be https://blastpad.io/ and the intent here would be to have a very modern design with video and a cutting-edge presentation detailing the process of creating a token, doing the airdrop, and then allowing holders to stake the token. The plan is to have all of these features on 1 easy to use platform. 

The Domains for this project:
+ https://blastpad.io/
+ https://tokencreate.io/ 
+ https://airdropperpro.com/ 
+ https://dailystake.io/ 

- The token creation page will be https://tokencreate.io/ and the idea would be a front end, easy to use, platform where non-tech savvy creators can create a token on the Proton blockchain very simply by answering some questions and uploading a token design. 
- The next part of the platform is the airdropping portion. The page we will be using is https://airdropperpro.com/ and will be an easy to use, but highly functional, air dropping platform. We have created filters that can be used to qualify users for token air drops. An example of these filters would be “Air Drop to users that hold (At least 1000) (XPR) for at least (90) days”. The ( ) represents the filters that can be modified to limit the tokens of the air drop to a targeted group of users. Next, we have included 2 forms of Air Drop. 
- Airdrop Push – In this instance, the airdrop is pushed out to all users that qualify for the drop. The token creator would filter for receivers, and then depending on the number that will be dropped to, pay for RAM, and send out the airdrop. 
- Airdrop Claim – the token creator would filter for qualified receivers, and set a number of days (such as 90) that the claim would be open for these accounts to go to airdropperpro.com, log in, and claim the airdrop. This instance would not require the sender to pay for RAM. 
- The fourth page with an independent URL will be https://dailystake.io/ which is a staking platform open to all token creators, to give them a central location to offer staking on their token. Our intention is to have multiple tokens on the page, all offering their desired interest rate. On this page we will also offer a “bonus pool” which will be an additional pool of every token being staked, and will be a bonus given daily to stakers of the BlastPad token. 

### Ecosystem Fit

1. Where and how does your project fit into the Proton ecosystem?
>Our project fits nicely into the existing Proton ecosystem, as currently there is no easy way to create a token, airdrop it, and allow users to stake it. Our goal is to grow the Proton ecosystem and Proton users by allowing easy front-end options with no coding needed. 
2. Who is your target audience?
>Our target audience is huge, and will include any new token project and any entrepreneur that wants to launch a project on Proton blockchain. There are massive existing hurdles that this platform will eliminate. 
3. What needs does your project meet for the community and what sets it apart from other similar projects?
>There is a glaring need for a front-end easy-to-use project launch pad. There are no existing projects that are tackling these obstacles and we see many new users coming into the Proton ecosystem because of this project launch pad.

+ Log into Proton blockchain integrated 

> Milestone 1 to be considered complete when the website with menu and integrated pages complete with UI/UX reviews.

- **Milestone:** 2
- **Estimated duration:** 30 - 45 days
- **FTE:**  1
- **Costs:** 10,000 USD

The $4,500 is strictly for the development of the token creation platform, and we are not asking for advertising reimbursement since we feel we will be able to attract more users to the Proton Blockchain by advertising the Airdrops and the Staking Portion, and we will include the token creation in those advertisements.

Milestone 5 is strictly an advertisement reimbursement. We would like to conduct paid advertising for the first 10 “Airdrop Claims” to benefit the Proton Blockchain and to bring users into the ecosystem to participate in the airdrops. 
We are asking for $1000 per “Airdrop Claim” and this would be to cover 30 days of sponsored posts on Twitter for each of the first 10 projects that use our platform and the “Airdrop Claim” feature. 
> Cost: $10,000 and paid as a reimbursement for advertising expense

### Future Plans

> How do you intend to enhance, promote and support your project in the future? Our team is full-time and growing. We are builders and we are constantly improving our platforms and adding more services and better functions. We plan to release the BlastPad platform and begin immediately advertising it through paid socials, with the goal of bringing thousands of users into the Proton ecosystem. 

### Additional Information

> We have never received a grant from Proton in the past. We are actively involved in the Proton community and believe in their vision for mainstream adoption. We currently run 3 metal nodes, run 3 dedicated servers, and have built a loan liquidator bot. We are actively working on an escrow platform, airdrop platform, a staking platform, and a token creation platform. We have plans after that for a web3 photography site and a travel site, both on Proton blockchain. We will then use the smart contract knowledge from these platforms to integrate into our real estate search platform.
