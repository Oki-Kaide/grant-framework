### Project Details

As it is becoming increasingly evident, we all understand the power of video in today's world. Video is KING. I am excited to present my video
package proposal to help the Proton and Metallicus ecosystems reach a wider audience and stand out in the competitive market. I am
dedicated to delivering high-quality videos that will make an impact for the Proton/ Metallicus communities. PDF Pitch Deck linked below

### Ecosystem Fit

1. These videos will help create media assests for the Proton community to share to increase global reach. 
2. This video package is specifically tailored to help the Metallicus team expand their reach and get their message and products
out into the marketplace in a compelling way.
3. As of now, there is no other project actively turning content such as Twitter spaces/ Youtube Lives into optimized shorts to be shared on other 
social platforms such as Tik Tok and Youtube Shorts. The commmunity is often times asking/begging to see such content.

### Team

 Andrew > Youtube Shorts https://www.youtube.com/@Bsprouts/shorts
### Roadmap

 I am looking to work with the team to optimize long form content into shareable short form video asssets. 
1. Create template for long form Youtube show reviewing the latest happenings in the ecosystem.
     optimize file sharing system for team to review and approve.
2. Create efficient systems to repurpose long form content into short form video optimized for YouTube shorts and Tik Tok reels.
3. Assess performance of video assets and continue to test and adjust as needed.


### Milestones

 Below is an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to the Proton Blockchain ecosystem. We _recommend_ that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone â‰ˆ 1 month.

> For each milestone make sure to include detailed specification of your software. Include the amount of funding requested per milestone, as well as the number of full-time employees working on each milestone. This information should be included in the milestone deliverables.

> FTE: Full-Time Equivalent (Number of people working on the project on a full-time basis)

> Total Costs: This should be the requested amount in USD for the whole project milestone. If the grant is paid out in XPR the amount will be calculated based on the XPR/USD exchange rate on the time of payment.

| ID | Deliverable | Specification |

| 0a. | Pre Production / I will work with the team to develop a content strategy that allows for the capture of long form content, which can be repurposed into Youtube Shorts, Tik Toks and Reels |
| 0b. | Production | I am asking initially for 2 (one hour) sessions a month with Marshall to create long form content. Which would also be set up in a way to efficiently allow for special guests. |
