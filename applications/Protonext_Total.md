### Project Details


> Protonext - Total is a financial aggregator, which in this case means it allows the user to view their wallet information, staking information, and loan in formation all in one place. Not only can you view all your Proton information in one place, what sets Protonext apart from other financial aggregators is that you can also view your traditional financial information as well. Traditional and De-Fi all in one place, it's perfect! The project is currently live, so instead of viewing screenshots please feel free to take a look at the project! https://protonext.io.

  

### Ecosystem Fit

  

>  1. Protonext fits perfectly into the ecosystem. Proton is all about DOING, from Loan to Dex, Proton is about creating financial systems to (I assume) eventually meet parody with a 'traditional' financial institution. However, there's currently no place to view your total standing. How much do you have TOTALLY invested in the proton ecosystem?

>  2. Primary audience is anyone with a Proton account. Secondary audience is anyone looking for a financial aggregator, or looking to get into the crypto world. If you store money in Proton or within a bank or investment firm, Protonext can help! 

>  3. Simply put, what set's Protonext apart is currently there's no place where I can go (other than Protonext) to view all my information in one place, especially not with traditional financial information.

### Roadmap


1. Completing integration with Proton Swap, including up to date rewards information and daily ROI:
	- **Tentative Completion Date**: Unknown - Blocked
	 - **Blockers** - Lacking documentation for Proton Swap tables, and how current rewards are calculated. Telegram channel questions went unanswered, and email correspondence is still ongoing. Email has been referred to the technical team - No estimated response time given.
 2.  Completing integration with Proton Loan, including up to date rewards information:
	 -  **Tentative Completion Date**: Unknown - Blocked  
	 -  **Blockers**: Lacking explanation of how current rewards are calculated. Telegram channel questions went unanswered, and email correspondence is still ongoing. Email has been referred to the technical team - No estimated response time given.
 3. Start Integration for NFT's to be part of net worth
	 - **Tentative Completion Date**: 5/31/2023  
	 -  **Notes**: Time frame of this feature relies quite heavily on availability/completeness/accuracy of documentation available.
 4. Release Alpha for Traditional Financial Linking to Key Proton Personnel for usability/completeness testing
	 - **Tentative Completion Date**: 7/31/2023  
	 -  **Blockers**: Completing Swap/Loan integrations, significant testing required, Legal documentation filed and Privacy Policy/TOS posted.
2. Complete Traditional Budget System
	- **Tentative Completion Date**:8/31/2023
	- **Notes**: This is a very complicated feature-set requiring quite a bit of processing and analysis on both the frontend and the backend, as well as having LOTS of UI/UX considerations. This could be pushed back depending on user testing.
4. Complete MVP, entailing the ability to link to financial institutions, view defi/centralized information on control tower, and be able to set basic aggregator metrics (like budgeting which is currently a WIP)
	- **Tentative Completion Date** : 9/31/2023
	- **Notes**: Like Proton's roadmap, this is relatively vague, and for good reason. As more and more work is done to get ready for MVP completion, more features might be necessary and push this back 
 
  
  


  

### Milestones

> Below is an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to the Proton Blockchain ecosystem. We _recommend_ that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone â‰ˆ 1 month.

  

> For each milestone make sure to include detailed specification of your software. Include the amount of funding requested per milestone, as well as the number of full-time employees working on each milestone. This information should be included in the milestone deliverables.

  

> FTE: Full-Time Equivalent (Number of people working on the project on a full-time basis)

  

> Total Costs: This should be the requested amount in USD for the whole project milestone. If the grant is paid out in XPR the amount will be calculated based on the XPR/USD exchange rate on the time of payment.

  

### Completing MVP of Proton Integration
  

-  **Milestone:** 1

-  **Estimated duration:** 2 months

-  **FTE:** 2

-  **Costs:** 15,000 USD


| 1. | Farm Integration Complete | We will complete the integration with Proton Liquidity Farms to give users an estimate of how much their investment is currently making them on a per-day basis based on current rates  |

| 2. | Article | We will publish an **article** that explains who Protonext is, our mission, as well as a "meet the team".  

| 3. | Loan Integration Complete | We will complete the integration with Proton Loan to give users an estimate of how much their loans are currently making/losing them on a per-day basis based on current rates 

| 4. | UI/UX | Completion of a Dark Mode selectable by the user

### Completion of Traditional Information MVP
  

-  **Milestone:** 2

-  **Estimated duration:** 3 months

-  **FTE:** 2

-  **Estimated duration:** 3 months

-  **FTE:** 2

-  **Costs:** 35,000 USD

| 1. | Traditional Page | We will ensure there are no bugs with traditional information, or with any charts that display the information. This will extend to traditional investment accounts and holdings|

| 3. | Investments Page | We will complete the investments page of Protonext, and ensure that users can view metrics about their investments (this is vague as it is currently unclear what information is available for investments under the Financial Aggregator API that we are using)

| 4. | UI/UX reform | User Testing to determine if the interface is usable by new/intermediate/advanced users. If not, allow for multiple views and FTUE for having a user select what type of user they are. Allow them to switch out charts for each page. Time will also be required to determine a mobile UI/UX workflow for all items

  

### Future Plans
  

> How do you intend to enhance, promote and support your project in the future?
1. Enhance:
	- Listening to user suggestions to increase usability, add new feature-sets
	- Parody with other financial aggregators to increase overall function of the website and appeal to outside (non proton) users
	- improved support for Proton as new functionality is added to the chain
	- Support for Metal Blockchain as documentation and information becomes available, leading to a way to view Metal Pay AND Proton AND traditional finances in one place. 
	- Editing of the Javascript SDK to add support for multiple users would be very beneficial for Protonext, and we believe other sites as well. By us adding this feature to the SDK, it would allow for analysis of multiple accounts quickly and easily (i.e. Personal vs. Business accounts, or even multiple businesses).
	- Substantial additional funding would be needed, but Protonext would be willing to consider building a complete **Tax system** for the Metal/Proton ecosystem. We believe that due to the complexity of the proton ecosystem, it would be beneficial to have a tax implementation done with a native project. We also believe that it fits the overall goal of Protonext, which is to provide global information about the chain and a users's use of the chain.
2. Promote:
	- We plan to promote Protonext through social media
		- Snipverse
		- twitter
		- telegram
		- discord
		- Youtube - Possible, not confirmed
	- We also want to use Google Ads campaigns to target non-proton users.
3. Support
	- Long term, Protonext believes it would be mutually beneficial to be bought out by Metallicus Inc., as we believe it fits directly into their overall vision of having an all-in-one financial software. 
	- If not incorporated into Metallicus's offerings, Protonext would most likely become a paid service, costing anywhere from $15/month per user, with every additional account costing $10/month. Monthly running costs are currently around $250, with an increase before launch of a minimum of $150/month. This number is not yet final as we still have to contact our Financial Aggregator API to determine a final price for our use case. This is not including  time that has been dedicated to the building of the project thus far.

  

### Additional Information

1. Tayler has contributed directly to the Javascript SDK, and plans to continue contributing (as discussed above in future plans) as Protonext sees possible upgrades in UI/UX/Functionality of the SDK.
2. Other than a $1500 purchase of a second Node by the Marketing Officer, there are no other teams or people that have contributed to the project financially.
3. A lot of the remaining portions of the De-Fi MVP are perspective due to the lack of available documentation on how rewards are calculated, which is why it is currently blocked. One of the best resources for the improvement of Protonext besides capital is access to developers and complete documentation. This is another reason why Protonext believes acquisition would be beneficial. 
4. A Node.JS/Express backend already exists for this project outside of the Proton Blockchain, since it is a public chain and this project contains financial information. A custom designed IPFS Swarm has been created to allow for multiple nodes to exist concurrently, whenever available. These nodes will automatically update when new information is available, and is secured by a private swarm key.
