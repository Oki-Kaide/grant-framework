## Project Details

Proton already has a strong NFT ecosystem thanks to the AtomicAssets and AtomicMarket contracts and corresponding APIs provided by Block Producer Pink. Additionally the official Metallicus team provided an open source NFT marketplace template which everybody can use to build their own marketplace.

Due to the limitations of the official API, there is currently no marketplace that is able to enable the full potential of all features the contracts provide while making no excuses in terms of user experience. Our goal is to provide the best UX ever seen in the NFT space by building a dedicated API and tailored UI that satisfies all needs of the Proton community.

We aim for a UX where our users don’t even notice that they are interacting with a blockchain. At the same time we want to be as transparent as possible - furthermore we will help and educate our users about specific parts of the blockchain.

We’re in close and continuous contact with the Proton community. Every feedback is taken seriously!

The market is live since February 2022, has been continuously improved and can be accessed via [https://soon.market](https://soon.market).

## Ecosystem Fit

We believe that Proton has everything necessary to enable mass adoption and that it is perfectly suited for NFTs. The WebAuth wallet is extremely user-friendly and transactions are free for all average users. We believe it is only a matter of time before Proton is identified by individuals and companies worldwide as one of the most important networks for financial transactions of all kinds - including NFT transactions. We expressed our beliefs in a dedicated blog article where we explain “[Why we strongly believe in the Proton ecosystem](https://medium.com/soonmarket/why-we-strongly-believe-in-the-protonchain-ecosystem-xtokens-lending-metal-dollar-nfts-5af25db0a8b0)”.

On top of our marketplace, we will build and enhance services, APIs and tools around, which we think add value to the ecosystem. One example is “Soony” - our configurable notification bot which is available for Telegram and Discord.

## Roadmap

1.  **New UI design** with additional features (including feedback & involvement of community)
2.  **Architecture redesign** & new **infrastructure setup** using Terraform (efficiency, performance, scalability); setting up an additional **staging environment** on **Proton Testnet** & giving community the possibility actively engage in the further development of Soon.Market (i.e early access to new features)
3.  **Modular** **core services** and **API** \- building a complete new API that serves the new design; provided Pink API has severe limitations and hinders us from shipping advanced features
4.  **UI** implementation
5.  **Go-live** - Migration of prod environment to new infrastructure
6.  **Contract** based marketplace **automation**: automate SOON SPOT NFT logic (burning + listing), automate payouts of marketplace income


## Milestones

**Note:**

* Planned start: Mid June 2023
*  Milestones 1 & 2 include work which can be parallelized that, if the grant is accepted, allows us to deliver the final results faster.
*  We plan to keep the community regularly updated on our channels and additionally via Twitter Spaces.
*  The clickable Adobe XD design prototype will be shared publicly with the Proton community, with the possibility to contribute.
*  During Milestone 2 the community will be able to keep track of the development progress by accessing the public staging environment on Proton Testnet.
*  The Open API 3.0 spec will be publicly shared.

## Future Plans

We are driven by a well-defined vision and an internal roadmap that outlines our plan to create a feature-rich marketplace. The foundation for future services and improvements will be set by the redesign and provision of our own API, which has been tailored to meet our specific needs. We are committed to consistently improving our platform and services, ensuring they meet the needs of our target audiences, including users, creators, and builders. Our ultimate objective is to expand our solution platform to meet the requirements of associations and explore new use cases, thus broadening the scope of our marketplace.

Areas(\*) we will take in consideration:

*  NFT Launchpad & Creator Tools (depending on the ecosystem state of these)
*  NFT Bridge integration
*  Soony
*  Whitelabeling of Soon.Market
*  Mobile App
*  Establish a DAO to govern AtomicAssets / AtomicMarket contracts

Of course we will expand marketing activities once we have taken Soon.Market to the next level.

_\* unsorted order, without prioritization, list not defined conclusively_

## Additional Information

We are well connected within the Proton community and in close contact to various projects and teams within the space. We recently established an official partnership with MetalPay.

We applied for a grant to setup the NFT Watch DAO and we started realizing a community driven approach for scam protection. We think this is an unique asset for the whole NFTs sector and we will support the NFT Watch to become a completely independent and decentralized contract governed solution. Decisions taken by NFT Watch DAO are already integrated into Soon.Market.

The work done to date on Soon.Market and it’s tools has been so far financed through personal funding from members of the team.
