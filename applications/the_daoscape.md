# The DAOScape Proton Grant

**Proton Blockchain Grant Proposal**
====================================

  

*   **Project Name:** The DAOScape
*   **Team Name:** [OnChain Software Limited](https://app.companiesoffice.govt.nz/companies/app/ui/pages/companies/5498642)
*   **Payment Address:** freeospromo
*   **Level:** Company
*   **Is Project Open-Source:** Yes
*   **Project has a token:** No\*
*   **Github Repo:** [https://github.com/FreeosDAO/](https://github.com/FreeosDAO/)

_\*The DAOScape uses tokens in a variety of ways, but does not have a native, bespoke, token created exclusively for "The DAOScape". The DAOScape Roadmap includes upcoming tools for individual DAOs to launch "Ecosystem Tokens", and the DAOScape uses XPR for resources required to launch a DAO. Additionally the DAOScape will take FREEOS as payment for larger DAOs to access certain features. DAOs built with the DAOScape tools can also manage treasuries of any Proton-compatible tokens._

### **Project Details**

> The DAOScape empowers people to create and manage value by creating and participating in DAOs with ease.  
>   
> Leveraging Proton's KYC, Proof-of-Personhood to ensure fair and secure voting, and reducing legal and compliance risks by not requiring governance tokens to operate, and enabling DAOs to generate utility tokens created from genuine work, The DAOScape can bring the power of DAOs to people and organisations that may have likely hesitated or never considered a DAO, prior.  
>   
> Offering features other platforms lack, such as token-free democracy, a user-friendly interface, truly decentralised hosting, proposals made up of any singular or multiple smart contract actions, and ecosystem-boosting incentives, The DAOScape is continuously innovating to stay ahead of the curve.  
>   
> Backed by a team with proven Web3 experience (Freeos, Altered State Machine) the DAOScape is revolutionising the way people combine talent and capital to democratically make things happen.

### **Ecosystem Fit**

1.  The DAOScape is a platform for easily creating and managing DAOs, that fits perfectly into the Proton ecosystem. Proton's focus on an improved user experience in Web3, and making it more accessible to everyday users, aligns with The DAOScape's mission of empowering ordinary people to participate in DAOs. By leveraging Proton's fast and secure blockchain, and built-in KYC features for a democracy-first DAO solution, The DAOScape can offer an even more seamless user experience, with reduced complexity, and reduced gas fees for users—truly delivering on the promise of DAOs, but for everyone.
2.  The target audience for The DAOScape is existing organisations wishing to leverage their existing communities, teams of professionals wishing to embark on an endeavour, creative talent, and those who may have been displaced by job losses or young talent, looking to combine experience around a common cause. With potential job losses due to AI, climate change, and financial crises, the DAOScape provides a platform that can provide ways for people to employ their talents towards collective goals with dignity. With fair and secure, multisig-enabled, treasury management, DAOs on Proton be a potential lifeboat for people or groups of people subjected to job disruption. The ease and power of the Proton ecosystem, combined with DAOs, would have great value in this situation.
3.  Not requiring governance tokens has opened up talks with potential partners interested in starting investment DAOs, Game Dev DAOs, Legal DAOs, Land/Property DAOs, AR Location-based Gaming DAOs, and Permaculture DAOs. Additionally, we are in serious talks with government officials in the Philippines and New Zealand about using DAOs as a way to organise incubator groups to facilitate startup cultures. All interested parties are highly motivated to engage due to the fact that they don't need the legal—nor tokenomics hassle—of governance tokens for voting or starting a DAO, due to Proton's KYC. Additionally desirable, are the lack of gas fees, and human-readable account names.
4.  The DAOScape meets the needs of the Proton community by bringing new users—and potentially capital—to the Proton ecosystem, by providing a platform for non-crypto natives to easily create and manage DAOs and common treasuries, without many of the risks and hassles typically experienced on other chains. The DAOScape provides significant value for the Proton community by offering a powerful platform for creating and managing DAOs, that can be integrated with the Proton blockchain, its tokens, NFTs, and users, as well as leveraging and encouraging KYC'd members. By empowering the Proton community to work together in new and exciting ways and create richer network connections, The DAOScape can help foster innovation and collaboration within the Proton ecosystem.
5.  The features, and benefits of our tooling have already been considered by existing Proton projects to facilitate their operations (see example [here](https://t.me/protondev/20016)), and we can envisage other existing projects will find use in these tools to help coordinate in a distributed and decentralised way.
6.  Ultimately the DAOScape onboards organisations attempting to build and manage value to have a platform that exists on the Proton ecosystem. Once these organisations enjoy the superior user experience of Proton, it would be hard to switch to other platforms that have much more friction and a poor user experience.
7.  Each DAO onboarded is an opportunity to create promotion, awareness and attention for Proton, while each DAO engages in marketing activity for their own efforts. Since DAOs can be spun up faster than creating bespoke dApps, the potential for increased promotion, awareness and attention for Proton should be much faster than the longer timelines required for bespoke dApp development.
8.  DAOs built using the DAOScape can already view and manage a treasury of NFTs, as well as Proton-based tokens. Since NFTs are a strong aspect of the Proton blockchain, DAOs can quickly be spun up for a group that wishes to combine and manage such assets. We will be building an example DAO that is managing our FREEOS Auction dApp as an example of how NFTs (and external smart contracts) can work with DAOs built using these tools.
9.  Additionally, every DAO spun up using our tools is a new smart contract, and therefore takes Proton resource fees, adding to the utility and demand of XPR.

### **Future Plans**

> This Grant would take us from Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to Minimum Marketable Product (MMP). This grant would lead towards a focus on growth and refining our product market fit with the purpose of creating world-class DAO building tools on the Proton blockchain to attract non-Web3 and Web3 users alike.  
>   
> Achieving MMP and product market fit would allow us to seek further investment to grow the ecosystem, thus bringing new users to our tools and the Proton ecosystem.  
>   
> We will be running "DAO-a-Thon" Hackathons and Game-oriented DAOs, that leverage community efforts to drive deep and highly active engagement, as more advanced extensions to the Contests run during the grant milestones. Additionally we will be creating DAOs for our own purposes, such as Community DAOs, that incentivise self-managing groups to service the community, and Marketing/Sales DAOs, that are incentivised to grow the ecosystem.  
>   
> We have further plans to add more types of governance systems to the DAOScape, including (but not limited to) fractal democracy, qualified sortition, holocracy, and token-based voting (including using NFTs). Additionally we have a system of modules we have been testing, that can extend DAOs to have bespoke features as well as useful tools, such as elections, payroll, jobs and escrow services, that we would ideally explore post MMP once investment is reached.  
>   
> Since the DAOScape combines Proton with the Internet Computer, we plan to leverage some of the Internet Computer's trustless HTTP Requests features, to offer oracle-less access to Web2 APIs and applications (such as data feeds, project management tools, and social media integrations) at some future date, to create decentralised, but powerful and interconnected DAOs.  
>   
> Finally, our Future Plans will include launching our native tokens, as well as qualifying DAO Ecosystem Tokens, on exchanges. This plan will depend on user activity, and working with a qualified market maker (we are currently in discussions on such a strategy). This is to ensure a strong launch and sustainable trading activity to support a healthy ecosystem.

  

### **Additional Information**

  

Our team developed the Freeos System on Proton—a novel type of democratic economic DAO—and has received grants from New Zealand's Callaghan Innovation Fund for this development, which provided our team with the skills and experience in EOSIO/Antelope, as well as funding to complete and launch the MVP of the Freeos project on the Proton blockchain in November 2022, and the Early Access features for the DAOScape.

  

Of note, by having the Freeos DAO and its community, we have attracted talented and dedicated volunteers and contributors from the community, three of which are included on this project grant application. This demonstrates the power of DAOs to attract, retain and organise talent and capital to work towards a vision. We expect to show other organisations how to empower—and be empowered—through their community, whether traditional businesses or progressive Web3 teams.

  

Additionally, our team received a Dfinity Foundation Grant as both our Freeos frontend and the DAOScape's frontend are both hosted on the Internet Computer. We were also a winner in the Helios Rising EVMIdeathon contest, presenting the DAOScape (before the name was settled on). Other funding has come from the founders personally, as well as consulting services for Altered State Machine and Futureverse, (working with large brands such as Mohammed Ali in Web3/Metaverse products leveraging Machine Learning).

  

The procedure of qualifying for the Callaghan Innovation grant has been rigorous, being a New Zealand government organisation. Having undergone this process including a financial audit, should give confidence to grantors and investors in de-risking and validating the team. And we are happy to provide additional details and testimonials from this organisation through private channels.
