### Project Details

Fishtank is a decentralised careers and talent ecosystem being built by Fishtank Labs, Inc.

Our vision and mission is to build a DApp on the Proton Blockchain that enables professionals to find job opportunities, and businesses to find the best talent. Additionally, by leveraging the WebAuth wallet and onchain KYC, we can build out a verified talent pool of professionals providing both quantity and quality to businesses.

The core problems we aim to minimise and/or solve are the following:

* Recruitment fraud - this is estimated to be a global problem costing $0.5trn - 0.75trn per year
* Expectations mismatch - this leads to a loss of money/time for both businesses and professionals
* Freedom/ownership - finance is changing and to be truly free, we need a global working culture to match it
* Costs - current talent/workforce solutions are fragmented and expensive - not configurable, modular, and affordable
* Integrated financial use cases - by leveraging crypto, the blockchain and WebAuth, we can offer differentiators (NFTs, etc.)
* Governance - tokenisation will enable us to allow users to be more involved in what features get added moving forward

Here you can find a link to the DApp designs in Figma: [Click Here - 4 prototype flows](https://www.figma.com/proto/9xWUmdCyI0PKGfa6qqZnGl/Fishtank-DAO-Web-App?page-id=0%3A1&node-id=293-81017&viewport=220%2C360%2C0.02&scaling=contain&starting-point-node-id=1820%3A139283&show-proto-sidebar=1)

We have currently made very good progress with the designs and are now in a position where we're looking to onboard a full-time developer initially to start building, before adding another developer later to support them.

Our new fishtank.ai website is already live and promoting the Proton ecosystem.

User --> website (fishtank.ai) --> DApp (app.fishtank.ai)

We already have fishtankjobs.com live - long-term aim is DApp will replace this.

Whitepaper: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Tq6roVws1If8m5NpcxDiAl152S-4LRBjqjAOZ64uTIA/edit#

Note: Fishtank will all be one platform DApp with modules, with a community based website in front of it, and later an NFT market to support marketing efforts. We initially were going to have two apps but this doesn't make sense. All will be decentralised.


### Ecosystem Fit

1. Talent ecosystem and network that can be used by the community, and governed by them via tokenisation
2. Job seekers/professionals (B2C) and businesses looking to source global talent (B2B)
3. Nobody else is really trying to do this elsewhere in this way, and the potential is huge given the problems we're aiming to reduce/solve. We can help bring more people into the Proton ecosystem as a whole, and show that we can have a global talent network governed by the very people who build and make our world what it is. Additionally, we can onboard businesses in the space, and due to us wanting to take a configurable and modular approach, we could potentially extend this out later with an API where developers elsewhere in the community can come and build modules that compliment the overall mission (similar to what Shopify have done with commerce).

### Target Audience

Our target audience is not just those within the crypto industry, but the entire market as a whole with a particular focus on white collar occupations on the B2C side, and businesses of all sizes on the B2B size scaling up from SMBs and growth phased companies to Enterprise clients. 

We have already conducted research here and there's clear demand from businesses of all sizes including Fortune 500 companies regarding the use of digital wallets to tackle problems such as recruitment and credential fraud, eliminating heavy manual processes through automation, and providing real-time analytics and reporting, and many other benefits that can be leveraged from using Web3 based solutions.


### Market Size/Potential

We have conducted in-depth research on this but a good case study of a similar venture that isn't blockchain based is Rippling. They started with a $120k seed check from Y Combinator and roughly 6 years later are now worth ~$11bn with solid YOY growth and revenue. Rippling are also heavily US focused and would not have the value add we'd have of talent pools, digital wallets to tackle recruitment and credential fraud, blockchain-based auditing, and many other use cases.

https://sacra.com/c/rippling/#:~:text=Note%3A%20Revenue%20and%20growth%20rates,150%25%20from%20the%20year%20before.

In the UK alone, which we do plan to move into the market at some point in the future, recruitment fraud as one problem alone is estimated to be a problem costing businesses $23bn annually.

Another good case study is HiBob: https://www.bvp.com/atlas/the-rise-of-hibob#:~:text=With%20more%20than%201%2C500%20customers,HRIS%20and%20people%20management%20platforms.

TAM: https://www.spiceworks.com/hr/future-work/articles/total-addressable-market-for-work-tech-to-grow-to-970-billion/

At $970bn for work-tech, even at 0.01% market capitalisation (SOM) that's roughly $100m. We believe due to our differentiators and value proposition which we've already validated, we can far exceed that in the next few years.

https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2022-09-15/mobile-wallet-market-to-value-usd-970-bn-by-2030-says-global-market-insights-inc

Also, the mobile wallet market is poised to become almost a $1trn market by 2030. A huge part of this ties into use cases in the work-tech space. We believe WebAuth tied into the Metalpay API and payment processing services will put us in a position to make a lot of headway in this area. Nobody else is offering a combination of Web2/Web3 capabilities, and self custody of assets. Also, nobody else is building a talent ecosystem and workforce solutions tailored to business professionals and allows them to govern it.

The only other player in the current crypto industry which has gained huge traction currently is BrainTrust which is proof there is huge demand for this type of venture. However, this is based on Ethereum, is more of a headhunting/talent scout solution, and doesn't really give users that much control over the features added, or their future. They also have nothing like WebAuth wallet.

### Milestones

- **Milestone:** 1
- **Estimated duration:** 9-12 months (initial release in 3-6 months)
- **FTE:**  2
- **Costs:** 100,000 USD

| ID | Deliverable | Specification |
| ----- | ----------- | ------------- |
| 0a. | License | MIT / Apache 2.0 / GPLv3 / Unlicense |
| 0b. | Documentation | We will provide both **inline documentation** of the code and a basic **tutorial** that explains how a user can use our dApp. |
| 0c. | Article | We will publish an **article** that explains [...] (what was done/achieved as part of the grant). (Content, language and medium should reflect your target audience described above.)
| 1. | DApp Setup, Login & Registration | We will setup the DApp, and implement the login and registration capabilities|  
| 2. | User Profiles | We will create the user profile functionality (At this point we will already look to release so we can get users signing up while the rest of the DApp is being built out) |  
| 3. | Company Profiles & Job Search | The job search functionality with job descriptions, and the business side providing them with the ability to post jobs |
| 4. | Company Search & Talent Search | The ability to search for companies and their information, and the ability for businesses to search for talent in the pool|
| 5. | Personal & Business Dashboards | The dashboards for both individuals and businesses|
| 6. | Admin & Settings capabilities | settings, security capabilities and customisation section |
| 7. | Fishtank Admin Portal | design pending but will be needed for Fishtank admins to manage individual/business accounts |

In addition to the above, time will be needed for resolving bugs, testing, and implementing feedback received throughout the development process.

Target initial release date: 3-6 months.
Full implementation: 9-12 months.

Other capabilities - to implement cost/time permitting:

* Goals - nice to have.
* Portfolio - nice to have.
* Dark mode - nice to have.

Our overall goal is to deliver as much as possible for the lowest cost, and within the least amount of time, while ensuring the quality of standard in product associated/known with the Proton blockchain.

Other deliverables:

* Provide initial liquidity needed to have FSH listed on Protondex (FSH:XMD)
* Small investment for supporting marketing initiatives such as a product promo video

Note: Due to the nature of our business, the above milestones/dates are target dates - we need to ensure what we are doing is compliant with labor law and other regulations, and this may increase time with releases. Due to this, as outlined further below, we commit to pushing changes to a staging environment link on a regular basis so progress is visible at all times.

### Cost Breakdown

Below is an overview of the cost breakdown to deliver incrementally on the scope outlined above. Our aim is to work in an agile manner with sprint goals, OKR based roadmaps, and a release roadmap.

https://www.capco.com/en/Intelligence/Capco-Intelligence/Capacity-Based-Funding-And-Planning-In-An-Agile-Environment

* Lead Engineer $7000*9-12 months = $63-84,000 (estimate)
* UX Designer = $1000*12 = $12,000 (estimate)
* Audits/Security Scan = $5-10,000 (estimate)
* Compliance & Legal = $5-10,000 (estimate) / US expertise needed
* Marketing = $2,500
* Operations = $5,000
* Infrastructure/Tech = $5,000
* Events/Travel/Partnerships = $2,500

Total Ballpark Estimate = $100-131k.

Note: In addition to the above we will be self-funding to support the business/project.

Ultimately, depending on market conditions, we anticipate the above providing adequate funding for 12-18 months due to us operating out of Central Europe - possibly even longer. We want to onboard a strong lead engineer who can grow with both Fishtank and the Proton community, and be in it for the long-term as an asset. We are not willing to outsource to cut corners as that introduces a huge amount of risk into the project.

Funding only to be allocated elsewhere (e.g, providing liquidity for a DEX listing) should it make strategic sense, and there is sufficient capital to do so - and it's something the community supports from an expenditure standpoint. We are happy to put this to another vote.

In the same manner as others in the market such as Gusto, HiBob, and Rippling, we believe initial funding would help us lay solid foundations for initial traction, revenue, and growth moving forward. All of these businesses are relatively new in a market that is constantly being disrupted, and none of them are blockchain-based or using Web3 technology. We have a real opportunity from a first mover advantage standpoint.

We have validated our idea/proposed solution with several Fortune 500 businesses, and will look to involve them as well as Metallicus in the development process to build a solution that delivers.


### Incentives & Proton Ecosystem Support

We are open to giving back to Proton in the future but Proton also needs serious projects to be built on the blockchain. This needs to be handled in the right way to the benefit of all parties - especially the community.

Non-conditional:

* 5% to go into a Fishtank Development Fund annually to support extension of platform/marketing - also brings value to Proton
* 50% of Metal and Proton validator rewards to be donated to the fishtanktr to derisk the project for token holders
* 8,000,000 tokens to go into 'fishtankdevfund' wallet to support development of initiatives across whole Proton ecosystem (the current valuation at 0.05 would be $400k - with a launch on protonswap we expect this to drop but its still a considerable commitment to the community from our side at $0.01 its $80k - realistic price given 128m max supply of FSHs)

Conditional contributions to Proton warchest:

* We will make an annual lump sum donation to the Proton warchest based on the following being met:
 * There are elections held to vote in a 7 member Consortium, and these are made up to be advisory roles
 * Fixed term limits are implemented every 1-2 years so the community gets to decide who represents them in the Consortium
 * Consortium pay is reduced to zero - we believe this should be an advisory role and a position of privilege within the ecosystem
 * There's a code of conduct released for Consortium members and BPs to reduce brand/reputational risk for businesses on Proton

The community does not currently have enough of a voice in affairs on how this level of the governance is run. As it stands, the Consortium membership is unelected and we believe this shouldn't be the case. These should be people elected by the community.

It is very difficult for us to agree to profit-sharing or donations when the current Consortium is unelected, and the community's voice is incredibly limited in matters of conduct and governance.

### Future Plans

* We are already working on our new website which is content and community focused - aim is to use this in multiple ways:
 * Drive awareness and adoption of Fishtank, and the overall ecosystem (Proton, Metal, Loan, and other DApps)
 * Generate revenue through subscription tiers and services promoted through the new website (coaching, consulting, resources, etc.)
 * Act as a gateway to the Fishtank Jobs website to bring clients into the ecosystem
 * Promote the DApp through it's development lifecycle and act as gateway to DApp (aggressive marketing channel)

Additionally, we plan to obtain further funding/investment to extend on the value proposition with modules focused on HR/workforce management - VMS, onboarding, core HR, etc. By delivering these we aim to onboard clients on a per employee per month model with costs decreasing based on volume.

While closed source, we do want to open up the project to invite developers into the project to contribute by building modules that can be accessible via a marketplace of talent/work focused capabilities, and later integrations. This would help get the community involved and bring more value to the project.

Furthermore, we plan to launch our own NFT Market dedicated to supporting clients that want to launch campaigns specific to the world of talent and work. We believe NFTs can pay a big role in recruitment campaigns, benefits, loyalty incentives, access, and much more.

Finally, we plan to continue with community engagement, getting involved in Spaces, and working to evangelise and promote the overall ecosystem. Fishtank only does well if the overall ecosystem does well and we pull together as missionaries.

### Longer Term Objectives

Below is an overview of our longer term goals to support our vision and mission - not included within the initial scope:

* Set up small coworking hubs that professionals can access and pay for with their WebAuth wallets
* More integrated financial capabilities for work - compensation, payroll, benefits, etc.
* Multi-year blueprint can be seen here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CaCLR7zQlxgAnA9IOzsAYdNVxXLm4lNI/view?usp=sharing


### Additional Information

> Include work you have already done on Proton Blockchain, are there any other teams or people that have contributed to your project financially, any previous grants you have applied for.

* We have already set up two Metal Blockchain nodes (1 personal, 1 for Fishtank), and plan to become a block producer on Proton
* Contributing to the community by holding Twitter Spaces and being involved to spread awareness and promote adoption
* We are committed to supporting the overall ecosystem - our DApp will include links to other DApps in ecosystem
* No previous grants have been applied for - everything so far has been self funded and we run a tight ship operationally
* No funding raised from the grant will go to Fishtank Labs endeavours (e.g. our company website), only Fishtank
* Developer(s) will initially be onboarded as contractors - FTE roles will have to earn it through outcomes/results


### Governance & Operations

* We plan to buy a license for Canny so we can clearly communicate a dynamic roadmap and capture requests
* Release notes and public facing documentation (API docs etc.) to be added to Gitbook
* From a delivery standpoint, we plan to use the Atlassian technology stack (Confluence, JIRA, etc.)
* If funding is granted, we commit to setting up a staging link so pushed changes can be viewed and progress is visible
* We will also do a monthly demo on progress with the community so feedback can be provided, and questions asked
* Generalised overview of expenditure (high-level due to legal reasons)


### Tokenisation

* Fishtank $FSH - core governance and utility token - max supply: 128m
* Jellyfish $JLY - complimentary governance token to enable voting when $FSH is unavailable (e.g, locked up in staking) - max supply: 1m
* Molly $MLY - fun utility token - a separate token participants can have more fun with later on by voting without introducing risk to the Fishtank token and ecosystem - max supply: 1bn

NOTE: None of the above tokens represent ownership in Fishtank Labs, Inc. (core developer).


### If Funding Is Granted

* Roadmap with quarterly OKRs will be set up and shared at the earliest opportunity (see example here: https://feedback.featurebase.app/roadmap)
* We are open to providing access to Paul G. to JIRA to have transparency into sprint delivery/goals
* Additionally, we have already committed to transparency elsewhere in terms of expenditure



### Additional Comments

We believe this proposal should go to community vote via the DAO dashboard. The community should ultimately decide which projects they want to see built on Proton. We believe this is the right thing to do in a democratic setup such as a DAO which is intended to give participants in an ecosystem more of a voice, and more transparency in affairs.


### Cost of Not Being Backed By Community

We want to be incredibly clear and honest in terms of what it means if we're not backed by the Consortium and/or community. Ultimately, our relationship with the Proton ecosystem will become one of a strictly business nature and focused around leveraging the technology. We will not make any contributions of any kind to the Proton ecosystem, and will for the most part operate as a private venture due to other obligations. Additionally, we will likely take more of a generic cross-chain perspective as opposed to a 'Proton first' perspective as this will increase our chances of success tenfold as we move forward with Fishtank.
